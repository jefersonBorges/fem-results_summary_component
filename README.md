# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

Any comments on the code are welcome! This time the challenge was to improve the acessibility and responsivity of the page. I Used JavaScript DOM to generate the HTML content in the attributes summary section and to calculate the overall result. What do you guys think of that?
